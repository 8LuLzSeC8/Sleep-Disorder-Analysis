# Sleep-Disorder-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sleep disorders using various data mining techniques in Rapidminer. The dataset includes diverse physiological and lifestyle parameters like the patientâ€™s daily activity, profession, medical conditions etc. that potentially influence sleep quality and sleep-related health conditions. The goal is to leverage these variables to identify patterns, correlations, and risk factors associated with sleep disorders, thereby enabling proactive interventions and better health outcomes.
